About me
======

I’m an Assistant Professor in Sociology at the Universidad Católica de Chile. Previously, I was a Max Weber Postdoctoral Fellow at the European University Institute and earned a Ph.D. in Sociology at Cornell University. I study labor market inequalities, intergenerational mobility and beliefs about inequality using a combination of statistical modeling, empirical strategies for causal inference, experimental and computational methods.

Research
======

My scholarly agenda is articulated around two core, complementary research streams. One series of projects examines key structural aspects of social inequality - intergenerational income mobility, gender and racial gaps in the labor market and educational assortative mating. Another line of research focuses on the cultural facets of social stratification as they crystallize in specific belief systems about inequalities and fairness. My work has been published in academic journals such as *Science Advances*, *Sociological Methods and Research*, *RSF: The Russell Sage Foundation Journal of the Social Sciences*, and *Research in Social Stratification and Mobility*, and covered by popular media outlets such and the *New York Times*, *Washington Post*, *New Scientist*, *Science Daily*, among others.


Methods
======

In tandem with my substantive research agenda, I have implemented novel statistical tools such as Bayesian models with structured dispersion for the study of sibling correlations, Lasso regularization for selection of log-linear models, micro-simulations for the study of educational assortative mating, and online large-scale experiments to study beliefs about inequality.
